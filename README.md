This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to run the progressbar-demo application.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Requirements to run the project?

1. Node js should be installed with version > 6

2. npm should be installed

  You can verify the above packages are installed or not using following commmands

    node -v

    npm -v

## Cloning and installing the dependencies for the project

  The progressbar-demo project can be cloned from [here]
  (https://github.com/Naveen-Private/progressbar-demo.git).

  once you clone the repository then do the following to install all the dependencies required to run the project.

    yarn install
  
  After installing all the dependencies then the project folder structure looks like below

## Folder Structure

The project progressbar-demp folder structure looks like:

```

## Running the application

  Soon after installing the dependencies then you can run the project with the following command

  The above command will open the browser with the default port number 3000 and can be access with [local url]
  (http://localhost:3000).

  If everything is working fine then you can see working model of progressbar-demo project.

## Testing

  You can run the testing for the progressbar-demo project with the following command as this project is comes with jest testing framework with the packages like enzyme, enzyme-adapter-react-16 and react-test-renderer

    npm test

## Styling the react components

  To style the react components i have used the styled-components package which helps to plug and play with the react components and also it helps the code should be more reusuable with styles.

## Note:

  1. I assumed the length of the progress bar is fixed.
